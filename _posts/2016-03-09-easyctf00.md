##I figured I'd give a bit of an update on EasyCTF 2016's development progress.

###What have we gotten done so far?
* The website has been redesigned, and we are about 60% finished with the front-end
* Problems are slowly being written, and we expect to have 70+ new challenges this year
* We are holding a logo design contest (more info on that soon!)
* We have published a blog [here](http://blog.easyctf.com)
* We have published a High School CTF Calendar [here](http://calendar.easyctf.com)

That's it for now, but I am expecting to post about once a week with further updates.

If you're interested in last year's competition, make sure to check out [2015.easyctf.com](http://2015.easyctf.com) and try out some of the problems!
